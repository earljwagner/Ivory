<h2>Ivory: Preprocessing and Indexing Pipeline</h2>

<div class="post">
<div class="content">

<p>Prior to indexing a text collection, we must go through several
preprocessing steps.  First, each document must be assigned a
sequentially-numbered integer, from 1 to <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is
the size of the collection.  We refer to this as the docno (in Ivory,
always a four-byte int), while the original collection-specific
document identifier is referred to as the docid, which is typically an
alphanumeric identifier (in Ivory, always a String).</p>

<p>Numbering the
documents is handled by classes in the edu.umd.cloud9.collection.*
packages
in <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/index.html">Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup></a>
(a separate package for each common collection).  See documentation
there for more details.  The docid to docno mapping data is usually
stored in a file named docno-mapping.dat in the index directory.</p>

<p>As a side note, this is slightly confusing since some collections
(e.g., TREC) use the XML tag &lt;DOCNO&gt; to denote the docid.
However, Ivory documentation is consistent about its reference to
docnos and docids.</p>

<p>Once the docid to docno mapping has been created, we can proceed
with the Ivory processing pipeline, which is shown below:</p>

<p><img style="margin-left: 50px;" width="25%" src="images/ivory-preprocessing.png" alt="Ivory Preprocessing Pipeline" /></p>

<p>Here's a description of each step in detail:</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Build term document vectors.</b>  All documents are parsed into
document vectors (with stemming and stopword removal), represented as
associative arrays from terms to term frequencies (<i>tfs</i>) and
positional information.  We call these term document vectors.  At the
same time we build a table of document lengths, necessary for
retrieval later.</li>

<li><b>Extract document frequency and collection frequency data.</b>
Document frequencies (<i>dfs</i>) and collection frequencies
(<i>cf</i>) are extracted from the postings.  This stage allows
user-specified thresholds for dropping terms from the collection based
on an upper <i>df</i> limit and a lower <i>df</i> limit.  An upper
limit drops common terms, reducing the size of the index.  A lower
limit drops rare terms, reducing the vocabulary size.  The dictionary
and associated statistics are used in the next stage and for other
purposes as well.</li>

<li><b>Map terms to term ids.</b>  A mapping from terms to integers
term ids is constructed.  The terms are sorted by ascending document
frequency, i.e., term 1 is the term with the highest <i>df</i> (after
any user-specified filtering), term 2 is the term with the second
highest <i>df</i>, etc.  This stage generates a number of data files
that facilitates mapping between term and term ids.  The resulting
dictionary is compressed with front-coding.</li>

<li><b>Build integer document vectors.</b>  Finally, a new set of
document vectors are generated in which terms are replaced with the
integer term ids.  We call these int document vectors, contrasted with
term document vectors from the first stage.  Furthermore, within each
document vector the terms are sorted in increasing term id, so that we
are able to efficiently encode gap differences.</li>

</ol>

<p>After the collection has been preprocessed, we can proceed to index
it.  The inverted index is built from the int document vectors.  The
IP indexing algorithm is described in
<a href="publications/Lin_etal_TREC2009.pdf">our TREC 2009 paper</a>.</p>

<p>One frequently asked question is: why not index the collection
directly?  Why go through the extra steps of materializing the
document vectors (both term and int variants)?  The reason is to
support relevance feedback.  Relevance feedback requires access to
document contents, so the two options are to reparse the documents
on-the-fly, or to store the document vectors for easy access.  Storing
document vectors with the actual vocabulary is inefficient, so this is
why we create int document vectors.  Only int document vectors are
used in the retrieval process, so term document vectors can be deleted
once the int variants are generated; however, term document vectors
may be useful for independent reasons.</p>
